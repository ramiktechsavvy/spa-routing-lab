# 🚀 SPA Routing Lab – React Router

This project demonstrates **Single Page Application (SPA) routing** using **React Router**. It is designed as a **lab experiment project** covering basic routing, navigation, and multi-page SPA concepts with a clean and simple UI.

---

## 📌 Aim of the Project

To implement client-side routing in a React Single Page Application using React Router, enabling navigation between multiple views without reloading the page.

---

## 🧪 Experiments Covered

### ✅ Experiment 1: Basic Client-Side Routing

* Setup of `BrowserRouter`
* Defining routes using `Routes` and `Route`
* Rendering components based on URL

### ✅ Experiment 2: Navigation Using Link Component

* Navigation using `Link`
* Smooth page transitions without reload

### ✅ Experiment 3: Multi-Page SPA Using Routing

* Multiple pages (Home, About, Contact)
* Additional pages (Profile, Career Objective)
* Demonstrates real-world SPA behavior

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* React
* React Router DOM
* JavaScript (ES6)
* CSS

## 🔁 How Routing Works (Simple Explanation)

* The application loads once in the browser
* Clicking links changes the URL
* React Router matches the URL with a route
* The corresponding component is rendered
* The page does not reload

---

## 👤 Additional Features

* Profile page with circular profile image
* Career Objective page with skills list
* Clean and simple UI
* Beginner-friendly code structure

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

* Understanding of SPA concept
* Usage of React Router
* Difference between routing and page reload
* Component-based architecture
